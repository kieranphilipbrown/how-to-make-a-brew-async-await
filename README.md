## â˜• How to Make a Brew Using Async Await

A simple, visual way to understand async await by making a cup of tea.

### Set Up

A basic Gulp 4 boilerplate to get developing locally with a few helpful tools already set up.

Tasks included:

- HTML minify (on build)
- CSS autoprefixer
- Sass minify
- JS minify
- Image minify
- Nunjucks
- Live reload

## How to run

Install Gulp globally (if you don't already have it).

    npm install gulp-cli -g

Install necessary packages

    npm install

Run Gulp.

    gulp

The live reload task should then initiate the project on http://localhost:3000. If that port is already taken it will default to another number such as localhost:3001.

## Building assets

To build assets without starting a local server with live reload, use the build command:

    gulp build
